Loops over Event logs created by running LCBC’s MiniCity-task and
generates summary statistics formatted for use in the NOAS database at
LCBC.

Content: - `data`: necessary data for the project. Do not write to it,
only read from it. Don’t commit to git history.  
- `R`: contains R custom functions you make and maybe use several
places.  
- `docs`: documents, like Rmarkdown.  
- `scripts`: analysis scripts and pipelines. Reads from data, sources R
and runs analyses. Writes outputs to `results` or `figures`.  
- `results`: code output and results.
